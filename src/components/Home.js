		<h2>An Archive of Unnamed Women</h2>
			<p><em>An Archive of Unnamed Women</em> is a speculative remix that recovers photographs of unidentified women in digital photography collections. This project highlights a critical discussion about gendered power relations in archived visual materials that are saved as part of a digital object&#8217;s metadata. Choose a collection to view from the All Collections pull-down menu.

      <h2>NYPL and Other Collections Coming Soon</h2>

		<h2>Workshops</h2>
 <p>At conferences, gatherings, and festivals, our feminist remix workshop includes an opportunity for participants to select a quote for the woman they are most drawn to, and print a postcard in remembrance while simultaneously engaging a conversation about how and why these images have been shifted to the background of the archive through algorithms and gendered power relations writ large. We hang a hand-made quilt with a screen in the centerpiece, whereupon attendees who have signed their names in our guestbook will see that they have been included into the fabric of the projectâ€”our archive of named participants. </p>

		<h2>Help Us Unmake This Project: Identify a Woman</h2>
 <p>Included in this project is a button that links to a form we are using for people who can identify a women. One marker of success would be the undoing of the project. If you can identify a person included in our image set, press the Identify button and fill in the form that follows. We will put you in touch with the archivist who can update the photograph descriptions and add names to the faces of women from the past.  </p>
